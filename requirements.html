<h5><strong>Context:</strong></h5>

<li>This game will be available on macOS, Windows, and Linux. The game is created in the Unity engine.</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Domain Model with Description:</strong></h5>

<h5><strong>Product Function:</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Game Levels:</strong> The game will have a certain number of levels(amount to be determined). The player will have a certain number of lives per level(amount to be determined). As the difficulty of the levels increases, the respawning of lives at the beginning of each game level will stop. It will be required to beat all the spawned enemies and a boss to move on to the next level.</li>
<li><strong>Bosses:</strong> There will be one boss per level. Each boss will have its sprite, list of moves, and specific location hardcoded in the game. They will also spawn mini-bosses as part of the fight.</li>
<li><strong>Combat Systems(Lasers):</strong> The combat system will be a laser fired from the player ship. When the player presses the proper key(default shoot key: spacebar) lasers will shoot. A fire rate system will be added to stop players from spamming the shoot key or setting up a macro to press the button for them. The laser, once fired, will travel straight forward at a constant rate.</li>
<li><strong>Enemies:</strong> There will be four types of enemies within the game. The most likely to spawn and weakest will be the scrub/regular enemy. The next strongest enemy will be the captain. This enemy will move and shoot faster than the scrub/regular enemy. Next is the mini-boss, who will be spawned before or during the boss fight and will be as strong or stronger than the captain. The most powerful enemy is the boss. The boss will be the hardest enemy to beat, with the most health and offensive capabilities. All enemies, except the boss, can be spawned randomly throughout the level, and all enemies must be defeated to move to the next level.</li>
<li><strong>Powerups and Debuffs:</strong> There will be up to 5 different powerups/debuffs based on the difficulty chosen by the player. In all difficulty levels, there will be: the Multishot, Shield, Add Life powerups, and the Firerate down debuff. As the difficulty increases the will be a Remove One life debuff. The Multishot powerup will make the ship shoot three lasers instead of one laser per shoot key pressed. The shield will allow the player to get hit once by an enemy attack without losing a life. The Add Life powerup will add one life to the player's life count. In higher difficulty levels, we add a max life count so that the player cannot stock up on them using this buff. The Firerate down debuff slows the rate the player can shoot a laser. The Remove life debuff will take one life from the player's life count. This debuff will only be actively spawning in the high difficulty levels.</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty Levels:</strong> There will be at least three difficulty levels. Easy, Medium, and Hard. This design may change as we get further along in the game development.</li>
<li><strong>Score:</strong> Each kill on an enemy will gain the player points displayed on the screen. Each type of enemy will have a different number of points alloted to them. If time permits, we will implement a way of saving the scores and comparing them with others.</li>
</ul>
