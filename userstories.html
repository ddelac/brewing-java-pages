<h4><strong>Speedrunner:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As a speedrunner, I want a game that is not too easy nor too hard, and I want to see both score and time displayed in worldwide leaderboards. This game should also have an incentive to play, for example, a good ending or fun and creative gameplay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elaboration;</strong> By creative gameplay, I mean that the gameplay is not the same every time the player should not be able to play to the point where you already know what to expect. Every time you play, you should get a random order of challenges. As for a good incentive, I would like to have a good ending that makes you want to see that scene again and keep playing to improve and get there faster.</p>

<h4><strong>Competitive:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>As a competitive player, I want to see my score compared against other players and work to move up the ranks.</li>

<li><strong>Implementation:</strong> 4-8 hours</li>
<li><strong>Total:</strong> 8-16 hours</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Acceptance Test;</strong> Run through the game multiple times with different scores. Write each score down on a piece of paper. Put the written scores in order from most to least. Finally, check the written list against the rank/scoreboard.</li>
